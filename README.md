# SQL_AppStore
## Project Context:
We have a CSV file called applestore.csv, which I got from Kaggle. It gives a lot of information about apps like names, sizes, ratings, the number of supported devices, the number of supported languages, and much more.

But there's another dataset called applestore_description.csv, which contains an overview of each application description

RDBMS: SQLite

After SQL Exploration, final Recommendations for clients:
- Paid apps generally achieve higher rates than free apps
- Our analysis found that apps supporting a modern number of languages between 10 and 30 at the highest average rating
- Finance and book apps have low user ratings
- The length of the app description has a positive correlation with the user ratings, so users likely appreciate having a clear understanding of the app's features and capabilities before they download and so a detailed well-crafted app description can set click expectations and eventually increase the satisfaction of users
